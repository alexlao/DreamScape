The major goal of our game, Dreamscape, is to get through all the different types of stages of nightmares as quickly as possible - in order to get a good night rest and to wake up in time for the main character, Allistar, to take the ACT. The time of completion determines the quality of Allistar’s sleep, which directly affects his test score. For the platform level, the basic rules of the game requires that the player must be on a platform in order to move forward and backward or to jump. On top of that, the player must avoid the enemies on the platform stage to survive. After the platform world, the player will be brought to the boss world. In this world, the rules require that the player must shoot the boss enough times - while avoiding the boss’s attacks - to stay alive. The main controls used in this game is WASD. In the platformer stage, the W key will be used to jump, A to move backward, and D to move forward. The keystrokes are the same in the boss stage, but W is to move upwards and S is used to move downwards. Furthermore, the mouse and mouse buttons are used to aim and shoot in the boss level.


The main features that this prototype demonstrates these new features from milestone 2:

- a full game tutorial

- smoother jumping mechanics in the platforming level

- mouse-based control in the boss level

- mouse-based control in the shop

- generally improved art

- generally improved sound (sound effects and implemented music in some stages)

- enemies within the platforming levels

- added another level

- buying items in the shop actually does something

- the first boss battle is juicier, more challenging, and has more descriptive meaningful play

- ability to kill enemies in the platforming level

- added lives
